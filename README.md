## Graphql Example in Python

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a language to query your API. It is a fairly new thing, and since it was released by Facebook and used extensively by them, and announced at React.js conference, vast tutorials are focused on using it on the frontend, or using existing solutions with a lot of magic behind the scenes.

This repo just uses minimal [graphene](https://graphene-python.org/) package, and no DB at all.

You have to have python3+ to run these examples.

```sh
python graph_ql.py
```
